Before starting the project, I'm feeling much more confident in using Git, the command line, and more advanced CSS topics like Flexbox. I hope to be able to consider myself a functioning beginner at HTML/CSS once this project is complete so I can incorporate JavaScript into my learning.

I found this project much more fun and inspiring than I imagined before. I know it was not part of the original plan to add any responsiveness to it, but I took a stab at trying to do my best because I didn't like how everything stretched out whenever I was at full screen width. It's certainly not a well-designed responsive website, but it has promise. I had to search for SO MUCH more than I thought I would, proving that it was a very good learning assignment, and I feel much better with Flexbox and standard CSS properties now.
